## Elevator Logic

We want to simulate an elevator that has n floors where n > 1.
Each request to the elevator will require the following information: the start floor, the requested floor, and a time stamp of the request, which is important for deciding how long the elevator will take to get back to the start floor.

If the elevator is on its way down, it will continue downward until all requests to go to a lower floor are complete.

If the elevator is on its way up, it will continue upward until all requests to go to an upper floor are complete.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
